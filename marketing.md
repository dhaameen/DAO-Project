# Affirmative Marketing Strategy to Build a Community on web3
Our DAO aims to help issues within the mental health area. Creating a more social and positive community so people can express their experiences and share positive stories in a safe place.
Group5DAO coordinates efforts and problem solving around crypto and blockchain applications and aims to help people through difficulties or hardships.

## 1.	 A Clearly Defined Mission
Our DAO coordinates efforts and problem solving around crypto and blockchain applications and aims to help people through difficulties or hardships. Ways for people/businesses to get involved include:
-	Crowdfunding for particular issues that arise within society
-	Funding mental health research
-	Events to broaden awareness
-	Voting rights on areas that need more focus than others
-	Bring mental health to the forefront of issues around the world
-	Build a more positive outlook on mental health issues 

## 2.	 Build a Community Online
Can be done through platforms such as Telegram or Discord as it gives everyone a voice within a bubble to express their opinions. This helps by:
-	Promoting cooperation
-	Helps to bring awareness to topics which may be overlooked
-	Gets a good gage on what people really want to help with, build awareness for 

## 3.	 Reward Members of Our DAO for Input into Our Community.
To create a successful DAO, the more ways that a member can get paid means their will be a higher amount of community participation, so we need to increase ways someone can be incentivised. These include:
-	“Influencer” like posts. Rewarding users for posting content. More positive engagement gets rewarded in tokens
-	Hosting/creating a successful event
-	Starting a successful crowdfunding campaign
-	Bringing in new members 

## 4.	 Promote Voting
For a DAO to be successful, voting needs to be a regular occurrence. This is for two reasons. 
1. A quiet community means our program is not being successful. 
2. The communities ideas accelerate our growth, creating new ideas and possibilities.
